        The concept of quick fix refers to a temporary or short-term 
        solution to a problem or situation. It is a strategy that 
        provides an immediate solution to an issue without addressing 
        the underlying cause. Quick fixes are often used to address 
        urgent problems, such as technical issues, crises, or 
        emergencies, or to achieve short-term goals.
